## About Me

With over 30 years of experience in software development, I have specialized in PHP-based, database-driven backend systems since 2003. Since 2022, my primary focus has been on Laravel, where I develop robust and scalable solutions. My passion for automation and operational excellence has recently led me into the DevOps space, especially working with GitHub Actions and Docker-based environments.
